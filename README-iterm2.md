# iTerm2
> A combination of all best stuff happens in iTerm - daily use tool of a Developer Life.

Steps by steps

1. Install `iTerm2` — This is a better alternative to the default `Terminal`
2. Install latest `ZSH shell` — This is more powerful than the regular bash shell. We will switch ITerm2 to use ZSH shell.
3. Install `Oh My ZSH`— This is a `CLI` tool to easily configure ZSH and add themes and plugins to ZSH
4. Add two types of `Themes` using “Oh My ZSH” — some themes need extra steps so we will cover both
5. Install different `ITerm2 Schemes` — These are just color schemes for the UI
6. Add two different `Plugins` using “Oh My ZSH” to improve productivity
7. Enable `“ligature”` support so when you write an arrow =>;, it appears like a real arrow →

### Step 1 - iTerm2
> A best Terminal Emulator on macOS. Wish it available on Windows too.

### Step 2 - ZSH
> A best shell ever. Yay!

### Step 3 - Oh My ZSH
> I used Oh-My-Zsh for a long time when I first bought a Macbook Pro 13 (Mid 2012).
> I still happy with it until I install so many plugins cause slow startup Shell T-T.
> I'm considering switch to `Presto`. Coming soon!.

### Step 4

Clone this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt.git "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship-prompt"`

Symlink spaceship.zsh-theme to your oh-my-zsh custom themes directory:

`ln -s "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship-prompt/spaceship.zsh-theme" "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/spaceship.zsh-theme"`

Set `ZSH_THEME="spaceship"` in your `.zshrc`.

### Step 5 - Color Schemes


### Step 6 - A lot of Plugins

Use `Plugins Manager` for easy install, customize, setup plugins based on `Oh-my-Zsh Framework`
